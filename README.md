# Van-Life Project

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## About this Project

This project is ensuring to practically learn the React JS with the React Router 6.4.3 Javascript Library.

React Router is a JavaScript library that helps developers create single-page applications that are responsive and have a dynamic user interface.

React Router as a JavaScript library enables the client side routing. This wouldn't make a sense without knowing the difference between the SPA and MPA.

A single page application loads an entire html document and dynamically updates the content on the page upon the requests being made.

A MPA loads a new page upon every request being made on it.
