## Motivation:

1. Deepening the understanding of React Router DOM: enhance the skills in React Router DOM, particularly focusing on dynamic routing capabilities.
2. Exploring client-side routing: Aimed to delve into the intricacies of client-side routing, also referred to as dynamic routing, to better comprehend its implementation and benefits.
3. Mastering single-page application development: Keen on mastering the creation of single-page web application that enable seamless navigation without the need for page refreshes(yes, not a single refresh of any of the pages navigated through).

## Why this project?

- Purpose of the Project: The primary objective of the project was educational. Rather than simply studying React Router DOM theoretically, the person decided to gain practical experience by building a project.
- Learning by Doing: Instead of just reading documentation or tutorials, the individual chose to learn through hands-on experience. This approach often leads to better understanding and retention of concepts, as it involves actively engaging with the technology.
- Focus on React Router DOM: React Router DOM is a library for React that enables navigation and routing in single-page applications. By concentrating on this specific library, the person aimed to become proficient in its usage and understand its various features thoroughly.
- Thorough Understanding: The intention was not just to grasp the basics but to delve deeply into the library's concepts and functionality. This implies exploring advanced features, understanding best practices, and perhaps even encountering and solving real-world challenges related to client-side routing.
- Enhancing Client-Side Routing: The project aimed to improve the person's skills in managing client-side routing. Client-side routing is crucial in single-page applications as it allows for smoother navigation without the need to reload the entire page. By mastering React Router DOM, the person sought to enhance their ability to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Project Description:

This project is ensuring to practically learn the React JS with the React Router 6.4.3 Javascript Library. React Router is a JavaScript library that helps developers create single-page applications that are responsive and have a dynamic user interface. React Router as a JavaScript library enables the client side routing. This wouldn't make a sense without knowing the difference between the SPA and MPA. A single page application loads an entire html document and dynamically updates the content on the page upon the requests being made. A MPA loads a new page upon every request being made on it.

**React Router DOM** serves as a solution for handling navigation and routing complexities within React applications. It empowers developers to establish dynamic routes on the client side, facilitating smooth transitions between various components or pages without requiring the entire page to **reload or refresh**. This capability enhances the user experience by providing seamless navigation within the application.

# How to Install and Run the Project?

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
